# RobloxPageScraper
 An intuitive program that scraps the information from the roblox chart page and provides users the information needed to understand current gaming trends, either for development or academic purposes

# Usage of this project

The usage of this project is limited to its creators, meaning all unrightful usage of this file outside of its owners' intent is prohibited.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide Roblox developers and users a tool for broader understanding of current roblox gaming trends, either for academic or developmental purposes.

# Disclaimer

This file is an attempt at recursive non-supervised recognition of roblox gaming patterns based on the current API in which roblox handles the display of game charts, meaning if this API goes depecrated, the functionality of this project may do so as well.

This project incorporates machine learning practices, in the hopes of avoiding constant data updates in virtue of Roblox's everchanging user platform. However, adjustment of the model using the NLMahcineLearning Model I created may help produce better results when understanding roblox's current trends, this is up to the developer or scholars who decide to use my project.

# License and Recognition

Given this is a personal project aimed to help users understand the current gaming trends on the platform, I ask of you to credit me (Esteban Flores (c) 2024) in whatever work or projects you have made with the help of this tool. Thank you.
